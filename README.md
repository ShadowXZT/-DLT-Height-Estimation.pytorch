GeoAI is a library based on PyTorch, that provides datasets, model implementations and benchmark results for Remote Sensing data.

This library is inspired by TorchGeo and MMDetection. The main targets of this library include:

for machine learning experts to use geospatial data in their workflows, and
for remote sensing experts to use their data in machine learning workflows.

## Introduction

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

<details open>
<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.
